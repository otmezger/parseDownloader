# parseDownloader
parseDownloader is a node.js app that downloads data from a parse-server

In order to run this code, complete all the following steps:

1) Download and install Node.js

2) Using Node.js terminal, install "npm" by placing the command: 
	npm install

3) Using Node.js terminal, install "underscore" by placing the command: 
	npm install underscore

4) Crate a new folder with the name "exportParse", inside the folder that contains the parseDownloader files.

5) Request to the repository owner the 4 codes that are missing in the file "config_sample.js"

6) Create a copy of the file "config_sample.js", inside the same folder and name it as "config.js". 

7) Place in "config.js" the 4 codes obtained in Step 5.  

8) Using Node.js terminal, go to the folder where "app.js" is located. Run it using the following command:
	node app.js

*Be sure to be connected to the Internet during this step, in order to download successfully the data from the cloud*

9) When "app.js" ends, all the data from the sensors has been downloaded in a .JSON file. Now, you can run the Matlab codes.
